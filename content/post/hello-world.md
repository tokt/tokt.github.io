## Welcome

First post!

In theory, following this awesome [Hugo tutorial](https://fillmem.com/post/self-hosted-fast-secured-and-free-static-site/) should take 3-4 hours or so.

In reality, it took "only" 3 evenings of upgrading OS X, configuring git+github, figuring out access details etc.

Certainly feels like a great start. :)
